# pygeoapi demo service - master

Runs latest GitHub master branch of `pygeoapi` using
[Docker Image from DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/geopython/repository/docker/geopython/pygeoapi).
with a [local config file](local.config.yml).

A local [Docker Image](Dockerfile) is [built](build.sh) named `geopython/pygeoapi_master:latest` 
that mainly copies in the [demo config](local.config.yml).

This was needed (i.s.o. Volume mapping) to have [micro-dockerhub-hook](https://github.com/maccyber/micro-dockerhub-hook)
restart the service (as the webhook is done within a Docker container and Volume mapping within a Volume map does not work).

This service is restarted pulling the latest `pygeoapi` Docker Image whenever a new Image is built (via DockerHub autobuild on
the [pygeoapi GitHub master](https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi) commit or explicitly).

There is also a [stable](../pygeoapi_stable) version that runs the latest `pygeoapi` version also from DockerHub.

## Build-deploy manually
For example if the Dockerfile here, or the config has changed:

* make changes as normal via GitHub
* login to the demo server using the `admin` user

```bash
cd git
git pull  # or ./refresh-git.sh if pull somehow fails
cd services/pygeoapi_master
./build.sh && ./stop.sh && /start.sh
# view new container logs
docker logs --follow pygeoapi_master
```
